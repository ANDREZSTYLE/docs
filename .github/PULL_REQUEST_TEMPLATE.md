Please check the CONTRIBUTING.md file for relevant information and some
guidance. Don't forget to add the `Change-type` footer to your pull request. 
Keeping in line with the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). 

Note that each commit message (currently only the first line) will be
automatically copied to the CHANGELOG.md file, so try writing it in a way
that describes the feature or fix for CLI users.

Thank you very much for your contribution!
