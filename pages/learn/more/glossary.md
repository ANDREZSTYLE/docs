# Balena Glossary

At balena, we decided to write a public journal for folks to understand the internal workings of our company and how we do things. In efforts to promote a single source of truth the technical glossary has now been merged with our [public handbook](https://handbook.balena.io/). This helps us keep the glossary up to date and helpful for all.

Checkout the [balena Glossary](https://handbook.balena.io/glossary) to find definitions for both balena-specific and general terminology that's commonly used in and across balena.

If you don't find a definition for a keyword you feel should be present, then be sure to open a issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/balenaltd/handbook/issues/new).
