In this guide, we will build a simple **{{ $language.name }}**  At its most basic, the process for deploying code to one or a fleet of **{{ $device.name }}s** consists of two major steps:

In this guide we'll cover:

- Setting up your **{{ $device.name }}** device and bringing it online on the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard
- Deploying a **{{ $language.name }}** project to do image classification using the Edge TPU and then later deploy a new inference model on the device

Once you've completed this guide you'll be equipped with the fundamentals needed to continue developing your application using {{ $names.cloud.lower }} and be on the path to deploying fleets of devices to production.
