__Note:__ If you want to use the Edge TPU functionality of the **{{ $device.name }}**, you will need to use the [Python getting started guide][python-coral]. Unfortunately there are no **{{ $language.name }}** libraries for the Edge TPU yet.

In this guide we'll cover:

- Setting up your **{{ $device.name }}** device and bringing it online on the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} dashboard
- Deploying a **{{ $language.name }}** hello-world project on the device
- Developing the sample project: making changes and testing them on the device in real-time

Once you've completed this guide you'll be equipped with the fundamentals needed to continue developing your application using {{ $names.cloud.lower }} and be on the path to deploying fleets of devices to production.
